# wiz_telegram_bot

This little python program allows you to control your wiz light trough a telegram bot, using text or voice commands.
Is just a sample to put together differnts libraries and to do some POC.

It runs with Python3 and in my case I'm runing it on a RaspberryPi 4

The libraries used are:  
https://pypi.org/project/pywizlight/ -->Handle wiz lights  
https://telepot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ -->To use telegram bot  
https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/ --> Speach recognitiom  
https://pypi.org/project/wavio/ --> convert the audio to WAV for speach recognition  
https://pypi.org/project/pydub/ --> convert the audio to WAV for speach recognition
