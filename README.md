# wiz_telegram_bot

This little python program allows you to control your wiz light trough a telegram bot, using text or voice commands.
Is just a sample to put together differnts libraries and to do some POC.

It runs with Python3 and in my case I'm runing it on a RaspberryPi 4

The libraries used are:
https://pypi.org/project/pywizlight/  
https://telepot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/  
https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/  
https://pypi.org/project/wavio/  
https://pypi.org/project/pydub/
